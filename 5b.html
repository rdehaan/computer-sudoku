              We've seen how SAT solving algorithms work, and we have seen a richer logical language (ASP). Let me tell you a bit about how an intelligently designed solving algorithm works for the richer language of ASP.
            </p>

            <p>
              I will describe the essential workings of one such algorithm: <a href="https://potassco.org/clingo/">clingo</a>. This is a state-of-the-art implemented solving algorithm for ASP, that is used for industrial applications in practice, for example. Nevertheless, it is just one of the possible intelligent algorithms for ASP.
            </p>

            <p class="sidenote">
              (<i>Note:</i> Once again, if you'd rather just skip the explanations on how the algorithm works, and keep going with some illustrations on how the language of ASP can be used for Sudoku puzzles, just go to the next page.)
            </p>

            <p>
              The overall architecture of the algorithm is very much similar to that of the SAT algorithms that we saw. The algorithm uses backtracking search, with propagation to quickly make conclusions that follow from made choices. Whenever it runs into a conflict, it analyzes the conflict, and uses the learned information to backjump over previous choices that were not relevant to the conflict.
            </p>

            <h2>Propagation and learning</h2>
            <p>
              One important difference is that propagation can be more complicated for the richer language than it is for the simple language of CNF formulas. In some cases, it is like simple unit propagation. For example, when the program contains a rule and we already make everything in the if-part of the rule true, then we can directly conclude that the then-part of the rule should also be made true. Or when the program contains a constraint, and we already make all but one of the parts of the constraint true. Then we can conclude that the final part of the constraint must be false.
            </p>

            <p>
              When using some of the more expressive parts of the language, propagation get more complicated. For example, when the program contains a statement that uses a sum whose value depends on the truth of some variables, the algorithm has to reason about the possible values that this sum can still take to see if any conclusions can be made about the statement.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because the propagation can take more complicated forms, the conflict analysis can also be a bit more involved. For example, the algorithm has to take a bit of care in the analysis to see which choices are relevant to the conflict, and which ones aren't.
            </p>

            <h2>More checking</h2>
            <p>
              In our explanation of the language of ASP, we swept some details under the rug. These details can also make the search process a bit more complicated than in the case of SAT. For example, answer sets exclude the case where true statements are (only) justified by a cyclic argument. What I mean with this is the following. Suppose a program has two rules that say "If A then B" and "If B then A" (and no other rules about A and B). Then making A and B true will satisfy these rules, but this is not an answer set. (Again, I'm not explaining the details of how this works exactly.)
            </p>

            <p>
              What the algorithm does is to perform checks throughout the search, to rule out any such cyclic arguments. It does some bookkeeping to detect any (purely) cyclic argument, and whenever it finds one, it adds a new constraint to the program to avoid this cyclic argument. This new constraint of course interacts with the rest of the search process. It can trigger propagation and force a conflict, which leads to analysis and learning, and so forth.
            </p>

            <h2>Bells and whistles</h2>
            <p>
              The algorithms that we have seen in this explainer leave open a lot of choices, and can be extended and tweaked in many ways. For example, a very important decision is the order in which choices are made. This can have an enormous effect on how long the search takes. If you make the right choices, you can get to the solution very quickly, but if you make the wrong choices, it can lead you to search a long time.
            </p>

            <p>
              Clingo offers a large set of options and add-ons that extend and tweak the basic algorithm. To give you a rough idea, the source code of clingo contains many thousands of lines of code, and if you print the instructions for the options of clingo, you get hundreds of lines of instructions.
            </p>

            <p>
              One interesting add-on to the algorithm is to restart the search from time to time. What this means is that the algorithm keeps all learned information, but undoes all the choices that it made, and starts from scratch in the search. Curiously, this can make the overall search much faster in some cases. The idea behind this is that the newly learned information leads the algorithm in the right direction, where previously it took a wrong turn.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some of these bells and whistles that can be added to the basic algorithm can improve the search in some cases, but have an adverse effect in other cases. It's a research area on its own to figure out what combinations of options work well in what scenarios. (Fun fact: this fits under the cool sounding header of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-heuristic">"hyper-heuristics"</a>.)

              Let's move on to see several ways of how we can express Sudoku puzzles in ASP.
