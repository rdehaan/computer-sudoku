              We can use the intelligence built into SAT solving algorithms to solve our Sudoku puzzles. To see how, let's remind ourselves of the general approach for doing this. It's summarized in the following figure (that we've seen before).
            </p>

            <div class="center demonstration">
              <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                <tr>
                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em; background-color: #eef;">Sudoku puzzle</td>
                  <td style="width: 8em;"></td>
                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em; background-color: #efe;">Solution</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>&dArr;</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>&uArr;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em;">Logic formula</td>
                  <td>&rArr;</td>
                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em;">Truth assignment</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>SAT solving algorithm</td>
                  <td></td>
                </tr>
              </table>
            </div>

            <p>
              In words, what we'll do is (1) take our Sudoku puzzle, and convert it into a logic formula. Then (2) use the SAT solving algorithm to find a satisfying assignment for the formula. And finally (3) we'll convert the satisfying assignment back into a solution for the Sudoku puzzle. Simple enough, right?
            </p>

            <p>
              So let's have a look at how we can build a logic formula that expresses a Sudoku puzzle, and how we can get back a solution for the puzzle from a satisfying assignment.
            </p>

            <h2>General set-up</h2>
            <p>
              The general approach for building the formula is that we will use propositional variables that we can use to talk about the solution of the Sudoku puzzle. Concretely, for each row index <i>r</i>, each column index <i>c</i>, and each value <i>v</i> (all from 1 to 9), we will use a variable <i>x<sub>r,c,v</sub></i>. Such a variable expresses that there is the value <i>v</i> in the cell (<i>r</i>,<i>c</i>). In other words, if the variable is true, the cell in row <i>r</i> and column <i>c</i> contains the value <i>v</i>, and if it is false, this is not the case.
            </p>

            <p>
              At least, that's the plan. This is the <i>intended meaning</i> for the variables. We have to do the hard work ourselves to actually make sure that we build the formula in the right way to get this to work.
            </p>

            <p class="sidenote">
              (<i>Note:</i> Before, we only had variables <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>, <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>, etc. These variables had just one number as index. Now we are using variables <i>x<sub>r,c,v</sub></i> with multiple indices. This is not changing the rules or cheating in any way. It's just to make our life easier. In theory, we could translate everything back to variables with just one index, but that would just be annoying and tedious. So let's not do that!)
            </p>

            <p>
              To get things to work out, we have to make sure that the formula expresses various things. For example, it should capture that no cell may get two different values. And that a value doesn't appear twice in a row, to mention another example. We'll get to all that in a minute.
            </p>

            <p>
              Suppose that we have built the formula in the right way. How do we then get a solution for the Sudoku puzzle from a satisfying assignment? That's simple. All we need to do is just "read off" the solution. For example, to see what value there should be in cell (1,1), we just find out which variable <i>x<sub>1,1,v</sub></i> is made true, and that gives us the value <i>v</i>. And so on.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now all that remains is to actually build the formula.
            </p>

            <h2>Expressing the rules of Sudoku</h2>
            <p>
              We're building a CNF formula. This means that we have to translate everything to clauses. What we'll do is take all the properties that we need from a Sudoku solution, and express them using clauses. This way, we'll get a whole bunch of clauses, which together form the formula.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first property is that <b>all the cells already filled in in the puzzle should stay the same in the solution</b>. For example, if in cell (2,3) there is a 4 in the puzzle, we add the following clause. (And we do this for all the given values in the puzzle.)
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <ul class="clause openclause">
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub>2,3,4</sub></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              Next, to express that <b>each cell contains at least one value</b>, we add the following clause for each cell (<i>r</i>,<i>c</i>).
              This clause can only be true if for at least one value <i>v</i>, the variable <i>x<sub>r,c,v</sub></i> is made true, which is exactly what we want.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <ul class="clause openclause">
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c</i>,1</sub></li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c</i>,2</sub></li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li>...</li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c</i>,9</sub></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              Expressing that <b>each cell contains at most one value</b> we do as follows. For each cell (<i>r</i>,<i>c</i>), and for each two different values <i>v<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>v<sub>2</sub></i>,
              we add the following clause.
              This says that the cell may not get both values at the same time. And because we require this for all pairs of different values, we get that the cell may contain only one value.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <ul class="clause openclause">
                <li class="literal openlit">&not; x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>v<sub>1</sub></i></sub></li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li class="literal openlit">&not; x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c</i>,<i>v<sub>2</sub></i></sub></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              We use a similar approach to express that <b>each value appears at most once in a row</b>.
              For each row <i>r</i> and each value <i>v</i>, and for each two different column indices <i>c<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>c<sub>2</sub></i>, we add the following clause.
              This says that no two cells in the same row may not get this value.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <ul class="clause openclause">
                <li class="literal openlit">&not; x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c<sub>1</sub></i>,<i>v</i></sub></li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li class="literal openlit">&not; x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>c<sub>2</sub></i>,<i>v</i></sub></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              In a similar way, we can also express that <b>each value appears at most once in a column, and at most once in a 3 &times; 3 block</b>. As an exercise, can you think of what the clauses look like that express this?
            </p>

            <p>
              And that's all! These clauses express everything that we want from a solution for the Sudoku puzzle.
            </p>

            <h2>Some bonus clauses</h2>
            <p>
              The formula that we built expresses all that we need, but it also contains a lot of 'hidden' clauses. To help the algorithm a bit, we can already add some of these hidden clauses.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, we also know that <b>each value appears at least once in a row</b>. To express this, we can add the following clause for each row <i>r</i> and each value <i>v</i>.
              This clause can only be true if for at least one column <i>c</i>, the variable <i>x<sub>r,c,v</sub></i> is made true.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
              <ul class="clause openclause">
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>1</i>,<i>v</i></sub></li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>2</i>,<i>v</i></sub></li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li>...</li>
                <li>&or;</li>
                <li class="literal openlit">x<sub><i>r</i>,<i>9</i>,<i>v</i></sub></li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <p>
              And in the same way, we can add clauses that express that <b>each value appears at least once in each column, and at least once in each 3 &times; 3 block</b>.
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
              Now that we've built our formula, let's see how quickly the SAT solving algorithm can find a solution for our Sudoku examples.
