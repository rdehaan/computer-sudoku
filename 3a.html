              For many search problems, it works extremely well to do the search intelligently like I described on the previous page: by learning from wrong choices, and avoiding big piles of (unsuccessful) work as much as possible. However, it can be quite tricky to implement this intelligent search. For example, the analysis and learning should be done efficiently, otherwise the algorithm slows down more by doing this learning than what is gained by speeding up the search.
            </p>

            <p>
              You want to make sure that you can use these intelligent search algorithms for different search problems without having to spend months on implementing an intelligent algorithm efficiently. Computer scientists found a way to do this. They spend a lot of time and effort to devise and efficiently implement intelligent search algorithms for one core problem. Then when you're solving your search problem, you translate it to the core problem, and you use the intelligent algorithm for the core problem. In computer science talk we say that you <i>encode</i> your problem into another problem.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem encodings</h2>

            <p>
              How does this work, encoding the Sudoku puzzle into another problem? And what problem do we encode the Sudoku puzzle into?
            </p>

            <p>
              The problem that we use for the encoding is called SAT&mdash;or satisfiability for propositional logic. The problem is to find out if you can make a logic formula true. In computer science talk, you can say that you're searching for a <i>truth assignment</i> that makes the formula true.
            </p>

            <p>
              The encoding has two main parts. First, a way of taking a Sudoku puzzle and translating it to a logic formula. And second, a way of taking a truth assignment (that makes the formula true) and translating it back to a solution for the Sudoku puzzle.
            </p>

            <p>
              The hard work is then done by the SAT solving algorithm, which uses the efficiently implemented intelligent search algorithm to find a truth assignment that makes the formula true.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a picture, this process looks as follows. The downward arrow is the translation to a logic formula. The arrow to the right is the intelligent search by the SAT solving algorithm. And the upward arrow is the translation to a solution for the Sudoku puzzle.
            </p>

            <div class="center demonstration">
              <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
                <tr>

                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em; background-color: #efe;">Solution</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>&dArr;</td>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>&uArr;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em;">Logic formula</td>
                  <td>&rArr;</td>
                  <td style="border: 2px solid #808080; padding: 5px; width: 10em;">Truth assignment</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td></td>
                  <td>SAT solving algorithm</td>
                  <td></td>
                </tr>
              </table>

              I will describe how this all works in detail in the following pages. Let's start with logic formulas and how to make them true.
