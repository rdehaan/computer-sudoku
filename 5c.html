            <p>
              Now that you have a bit of an idea of how the logical language of ASP works, and how algorithms can use the idea of conflict analysis and learning to efficiently find solutions for problems expressed in this language, let's see how we can express Sudoku puzzles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Below, you can view three different ways of expressing Sudoku puzzles in the language of ASP. In computer science lingo, these are called <i>encodings</i> of the problem of Sudoku puzzles into the language of ASP. Select an encoding from the drop-down menu below, and the page will show you the program and an explanation below it.
            </p>

            <p>
              The explanations will probably not be enough for you to really understand all the details of these encodings, but they should give you a bit of an idea of how you can use different types of statements to express Sudoku puzzles (and to help the solving algorithm a bit in its search).
            </p>

            <p>
              These are just three examples of encodings. One can think of many more encodings. For this explainer, let's stick to these three. On the next page, we'll see with how the algorithm of clingo uses these encodings to find a solution for our Sudoku B!

    The rules in lines 13 to 17 express that each value may appear <b>at most</b> once in each 3 &times; 3 block. This is done by adding constraints that in no block, a value may appear in two different spots.
