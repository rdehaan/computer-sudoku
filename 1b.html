              Many Sudoku puzzles can be solved using a handful of patterns, without needing to search for the solution, really. In fact, if you get to know these <a href="https://sudoku.com/sudoku-rules/">patterns</a> and practice a while, you can solve nearly all Sudoku puzzles that you will find in newspapers. Because pattern matching is one of their strong suits, computers can solve such Sudoku puzzles in no time.
            </p>

            <p>
              It gets much more interesting for harder Sudoku puzzles. In the rest of the explainer, we will use two example Sudoku puzzles as examples, one even harder than the other.
            </p>

            <p>
              To give you a bit of an indication of how hard these example Sudoku puzzles are, let's consider one way of rating the difficulty of Sudoku puzzles. This rating is based on <a href="https://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/index.php">HoDoKu</a>, an application that you can use to train different (human) solving techniques for Sudoku puzzles. HoDoKu assigns each Sudoku puzzle a difficulty rating that is based on how complicated the patterns are that are needed to solve the puzzle.
            </p>

            <p>
              The hardest puzzles that you will find in newspapers typically have a HoDoKu difficulty rating that is below 1000. Even the most basic computer algorithms can solve such Sudoku puzzles very quickly. For this explainer, we will look at two examples that are much harder.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first example (Example A) has a HoDoKu difficulty rating of 1836.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="center demonstration">

            <p>Sudoku A</p>

            <div class="sudoku-board"></div>

          </div>
          <div>

            <p>
              The second example (Example B) has a HoDoKu difficulty rating of 18134. To solve this second example, even the hardest-to-spot and most complicated patterns are not enough, and you really need to do the hard work of searching for a solution.
            </p>

          </div>
          <div class="center demonstration">

            <p>Sudoku B</p>

            <div class="sudoku-board"></div>

          </div>

          <p>
            This extremely hard second example is still no match for the most intelligent computer algorithms. Let's demonstrate this, before we dive into the working of the different computer algorithms.
