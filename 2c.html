            <p>
              I already gave a brief description of how the backtracking algorithm works, but let's dive into the details a bit more.
            </p>

            <p>
              The backtracking algorithm works as follows. We will describe the main steps of the algorithm, leaving out the nitty-gritty details. This type of description known in computer science as a <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode">pseudocode</a> description</i>.
            </p>

            <div class="center demonstration">
              <p><b>The backtracking algorithm</b></p>
              <div style="text-align: left;">
                <p>
                  <ul class="display">
                    <li>While no solution has been found, do the following:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>If the current state of the board cannot lead to a solution anymore (for example, two cells in the same row have the same value), undo the last made choice and remove the chosen value as possibility from that cell.</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>If there are no more choices to undo, stop the algorithm and conclude that there is no solution.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Use the patterns of naked and hidden singles to fill in as many conclusions about the solution as possible.</li>
                      <li>Pick a cell that has no solution yet and has some possibilities remaining. Choose one of the remaining possibilities, and fill this in as solution in this cell.</li>
                      <li>Repeat.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </ul>
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>


            <p>
              There are several points in this algorithm where there is some space to choose or change the details. For example, when making a new choice, we can pick which cell and which digit to start with. In the demonstrations, we just picked the first cell (going from top to bottom and from left to right) and the lowest remaining value. Other (more complicated) patterns can also be used to draw conclusions during the execution of the algorithm.
            </p>

            <h3>How to improve?</h3>
            <p>
              Why does the backtracking algorithm need so many steps to find a solution for Sudoku B? And how could we improve this? Let's reflect on this a bit before moving on to more sophisticated algorithms.
            </p>

            <p>
              The algorithm just makes some choices, and of course it can be the case that these choices don't lead to the solution. It will at some point undo these wrong choices, so that it does get to the solution. However, for hard Sudoku puzzles, it can take a while before it is clear that the made choices don't lead to a solution. And in the meantime, the algorithm keeps doing the hard work of searching. Put in computer science lingo: the algorithm goes through large parts of the search space where there are no solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the demonstration on the previous page you can see, for example, that the algorithm first chooses to put a 5 in row 1, column 3. It keeps the 5 there, while it keeps searching for a solution. And at the end it turns out that this choice was wrong all along.
            </p>

            <p>
              During all of this hard work, it keeps making the same choices in row 4, columns 2 and 3, over and over again. All without success, because of the previous wrong choice.
            </p>

            <p class="sidenote">
              (<i>Challenge:</i> Go back to the demonstration on the previous page, and see if you can spot the repetitive unsuccessful search that I just described. It helps to put the demonstration on a slower speed.)
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the elements of the more intelligently designed algorithms that we will get to is to avoid such big piles of unsuccessful work. In a nutshell, whenever the algorithm reaches a state of the board that doesn't lead to a solution, it analyzes what went wrong, learns from this, and undoes wrong choices that were made as early as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              To get an idea of how this works exactly, we will have to make a little detour and talk about logic. Let's go!
