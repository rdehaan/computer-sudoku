              As we have just seen, to solve the hardest Sudoku puzzles quickly, we need to improve the algorithm. One simple improvement that we can make is to make intelligent choices, rather than simply picking the next variable in line when making a choice. But there are plenty of other ways to make the algorithm better.
            </p>

            <p>
              One approach for this is to use a richer language than just propositional CNF formulas. This richer language allows us to express the rules of Sudoku puzzles in various ways. Not just by squeezing them all into clauses. Instead, with the richer language, you can use more informative statements to express the problem. Solving algorithms for this language can then intelligently use these more informative statements.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the final part of this explainer, we will have a quick look at one of these richer languages. It's called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_set_programming">Answer Set Programming (ASP)</a></i>.
            </p>

            <p>
              What's the plan? I will give you some examples of what you can say in the language of ASP. I will also give you a brief overview of the main workings of solving algorithms for ASP. I will then show you some ways how you can express Sudoku puzzles in the language. Finally, using a state-of-the-art solving algorithm (called <a href="https://potassco.org/clingo/">clingo</a>), we will see that this is enough to solve even Sudoku B in a heartbeat.
            </p>

            <p>
              Are you ready? Let's start with a bit about what this language looks like.
            </p>

            <h2>Logic programs</h2>
            <p>
              As the name already suggests, it is a sort of programming language. In fact, it is programming with logic.
              You can write <i>logic programs</i>, which are just collections of statements.
              The statements can be facts, rules or constraints.
              (I'll give some examples in a minute.)
            </p>

            <p>
              Like any good programming language, all programs have a very <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_model_semantics">precisely defined meaning</a>.
              To explain this meaning in detail would take a long time, because it is somewhat complicated.
              Fortunately, to get an idea of how you can express Sudoku puzzles,
              we don't need to dive into the full details. Some simple examples are enough.
            </p>

            <p class="sidenote">
              (<i>Note:</i> If you do want to learn more details about how ASP works, there are all kinds of resources available for this. For example, this <a href="https://potassco.org/book/">book</a>, this <a href="https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases/tag/v2.2.0">user manual</a>, or this <a href="https://teaching.potassco.org/">online course</a> are good places to start. Knock yourself out!)
            </p>

            <h3>Facts and rules</h3>
            <p>
              The basic building blocks of the language are facts and rules.
              Facts express that certain things are true.
              Rules express if-then statements: if <i>A</i> is true, then so is <i>B</i>.
              Let's look at a silly example.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the following program, line 2 expresses some facts. It says that 1, 2, 3 and 4 are small numbers.
              <!-- Or more precisely, it says that <tt>small_number(1)</tt>, ..., <tt>small_number(4)</tt> are true. -->
              (As you can see in line 1, like in other programming languages, we can use constants. Here, we have a constant called <tt>k</tt>, that we use in line 2.)
              Line 3 contains a rule that says that whenever <tt>N</tt> is a small number, then <tt>N</tt> is also a number.
            </p>

<pre class="program">
#const k=4.
small_number(1..k).
number(N) :- small_number(N).</pre>

            <p>
              Each program can have some <i>answer sets</i>. These are the solutions to the problem. Answer sets are truth assignments, just like we had in propositional logic. You can think of an answer set as a way of making all statements in the program true at the same time. The example program above has an answer set that makes all of <tt>small_number(1)</tt>, ..., <tt>small_number(4)</tt> and <tt>number(1)</tt>, ..., <tt>number(4)</tt> true.
            </p>

            <h3>Choice and constraints</h3>
            <p>
              In addition to the basic building blocks of facts and rules, you can use <i>choice</i> statements and <i>constraints</i>.
              A choice statement says that something may be true, or it may be false. In other words, there is a choice.
              Constraints say that certain things may not be the case.
              Let's look at our silly example again, and add a few things.
            </p>

            <p>
              Line 4 contains a rule that expresses a choice: whenever <tt>N</tt> is a number, then <tt>N</tt> may or may not be a nice number. Line 5 contains a constraint, that says that 3 and 4 may not both be nice numbers. (That is, 3 may or may not be a nice number, and 4 may or may not be, but they cannot both be at the same time.)
            </p>

<pre class="program">
{ nice_number(N) } :- number(N).
:- nice_number(3), nice_number(4).</pre>

            <p>
              Now there are more ways of making all statements true at the same time. And so there are more answer sets. In one answer set, 3 is a nice number and 4 is not. And in another answer set both 3 and 4 are not nice numbers. (These are just two examples, there are more possibilities here. In other words, there are more than two answer sets.)
            </p>

            <h3>Counting</h3>
            <p>
              The language also allows us to easily do some counting. Let's look at some examples.
            </p>

            <p>
              The following constraint says that there are exactly two nice numbers. How does this work?
              The first part says that <tt>C</tt> contains how many nice numbers there are. The second part says that this may not be different than 2. In other words, there must be exactly two nice numbers.
            </p>

<pre class="program">
:- C = #count { N : nice_number(N) }, C != 2.</pre>

            <p>
              This is a bit of a clunky expression: saying that it may not be the case that the number of nice numbers is not exactly 2. Can't we say things like this more directly? Well, in fact, yes we can.
            </p>

            <p>
              The following statement contains a <i>constrained choice</i>.
              It says that among all nice numbers <tt>N</tt>, there is exactly one that is a favorite number.
            </p>

<pre class="program">
1 { favorite_number(N) : nice_number(N) } 1.</pre>

            <p class="sidenote">
              (<i>Note:</i>
              You can say even more kinds of things in the language. For example, you can use <tt>not</tt> to talk about negated statements. You can use arithmetic, like addition, subtraction, multiplication. You can sum numbers, or take the maximum of some numbers. And there are even more features of the language,
              but for our Sudoku puzzles, the examples on this page are enough.) 
            </p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
              Hopefully these examples give you a bit of an idea of what you can say in the language of ASP. Let's now think a bit about how we can extend the idea of learning and backjumping to this language to get intelligent algorithms for finding answer sets.
